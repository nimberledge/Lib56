# Lib56
Library to build an engine to play the card game 56.

The library will include a means to validate game rules, and simple methods to run a game engine. It will be thoroughly tested, and the code will be held to a high standard.

The idea is that this library can then be used, with a wrapper presumably, to then create the game on android or as a web-app, etc.
