# Lib56
Game Engine and PlayerStrategy template for 56, the card game. The plan is to expand this into a web-app, but after we get an initial framework up and running, the app stage should be easier.

HumanPlayerStrategy is probably the easiest player strategy to implement, we can have that work based on input, and adapt that to the web-app.

Highly incomplete as of date, but if I ever get off my ass and make this thing a reality it will be a nice day for us all.
